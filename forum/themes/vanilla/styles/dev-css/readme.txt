STYLE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================

In order to enable this style, you must first place the style in the correct
folder in Vanilla. Every style works only for specific themes, so make sure that
you place this style in the correct theme's style folder by checking the
lussumo.com/addons listing for this style.

The path to this style's folder & contents should be as follows:

/path/to/vanilla/themes/theme_name/styles/style_name/vanilla.css

Once you have copied the files to the correct place in Vanilla, you can then 
enable the style in Vanilla using the **Themes & Styles** form on the settings 
tab.
