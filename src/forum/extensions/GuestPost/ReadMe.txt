EXTENSION INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

In order for Vanilla to recognize an extension, it must be contained within it's
own directory within the extensions directory. So, once you have downloaded and
unzipped the extension files, you can then place the folder containing the
default.php file into your installation of Vanilla. The path to your extension's
default.php file should look like this:

/path/to/vanilla/extensions/GuestPost/default.php

Before you enable the extension, you need to open up the default.php file, and
define the guest account username and password (you will need to set up a guest
account if you do not already have one, the username is your choice but i suggest
you do not use an easy to guess password)

Once this is complete, you can enable the extension through the "Manage
Extensions" form on the settings tab in Vanilla.
