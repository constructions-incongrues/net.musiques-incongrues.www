This plugin is based on IndexPhotos by Lincoln and Modified by peregrine and VrijVlinder to send linked images from the discussions in to the discussions index as a sampler.

If there are no linked images or attached images , it will not show anything. If you don't want an empty space where there is no image

replace the link to the pixel placeholder image with whatever you want in the class.indexdiscussionimage.plugin.php.
